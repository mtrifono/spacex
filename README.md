SpaceX web app - React exercise
Here is the demo: https://codesandbox.io/s/spacex-v05ud4

Created a react application that utilizes the Space X GraphQL API and provides the following views:
- list view of at least the past 5 launches presenting the mission name, rocket, launch date and success status
- detail view for those launches that further break down mission details and payload
- nested sub-navigation or component that lists other missions that rocket has participated in
The application is written using React, typescript, apollo for react, and utilizes the public SpaceX graphql api.
